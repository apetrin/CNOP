Code presented here is NOT FOR PRESENTATION, it is messy and uploaded for simple sharing.

Examples of Monte-Carlo simulations, performed using IPython multiprocessing module on maximum of 17 cores, are stored here. 
You can run the same code on your mashine, but keep in mind that you should first configure IPython cluster.
